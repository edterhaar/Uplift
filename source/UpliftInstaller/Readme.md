ProjectTemplate
===============

This project takes source project template files, and bundles them up into a redistributable .VSIX file that Visual Studio can automatically
install to set up a new C++ Project Template under the "New Project" window.

If using Visual Studio 2013 you will need to install the [Visual Studio SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=40758)
for the VSIX project support. Haven't tested on Visual Studio 2015.
